# archipelago-deployment

**Updated:** July 30th 2019

This repository serves as bootstrap for a Archipelago 8.x-1.0-beta1 deployment using: 
- minio.io (lastest) S3 alternative
- Apache Solr 7.5
- Mysql 5.7
- Ngnix 11
- Custom PHP FPM 7.3 tunned for Drupal 8
- Cantaloupe as IIIF Server with Video Frame extraction and PDF support
- A Skeleton Project setup to run latest Version of Drupal (8.7.5) and strawberryfield modules & friends on 8.x-1.0-beta1

The skeleton project contains all the pieces needed to run a local deployment of a basic Archipelago except (for now) content, which we know you will happily provide while testing!

# Starting from CERO

This is the recommended, simplest way for this release. There are a lot of exciting new features and improvements! 

## OSX:

## Ubuntu 18.04:

## 8.x-1.0-beta1

This is our first beta release and even when we have a Longer Path to travel until we feel we are ready for a full `8.x-1.0`, we are pretty excited about how far we have gotten in less than a year, our initial architecture has proven itself flexible to be extended, fun to use and code and solid to build on. If you like this, let us know too!
