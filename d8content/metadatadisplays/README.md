# What is in this folder?
## Updated Metadata Display Entities/ Twig templates for [Archipelago 8.x-1.0-beta2](https://github.com/esmero/archipelago-deployment/tree/8.x-1.0-beta2)

In there are two IIIF Manifest generating Twig templates files (.txt) in this folder that can be used
to generate Metadata Exposed endpoints in Archipelago. If you are installing Archipelago Beta2
for the first time you already have these, but if you are updating from Beta1 you probably
want to:
 - replace http://localhost:8001/metadatadisplay/3 `(IIIF Presentation API 3.0 Manifest)` with 
 the content of `iiif_manifest_3.0-draft.twig.txt` file.
 - add an additional one at `http://localhost:8001/metadatadisplay/list` named `IIIF Presentation API 2.1 Manifest` 
 and use `iiif_manifest_2.1.twig.txt` content as source for it.

## Where are these templates used? 

Several Field Formatters  (viewers) use as input IIIF Manifests generated by these. Also, 
Archipelago exposes Metadata endpoints which can be configured to use any of template at 
`http://localhost:8001/admin/config/archipelago/metadataexpose`, per Content Type.
